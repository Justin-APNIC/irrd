==================================
DRAFT Release notes for IRRd 4.5.0
==================================

New irt and organisation object classes
---------------------------------------
The `irt` and `organisation` object classes were added. This means that
in authoritative databases, users can now create these objects, and IRRD
will include these objects when mirroring other sources.
**By default, support for these classes is enabled.**
To restore the old behaviour, you can use the
``sources.{name}.object_class_filter`` setting.
You can query the templates using the ``-t`` whois query or see all
supported classes in the GraphQL schema.

Other changes
-------------
* The ``sources.{name}.object_class_filter`` setting can now also be used
  to restrict permitted changes to authoritative objects.
